                                    We have developed draftEzy at 2012. draftEzy was portable across platforms since it was developed in platform independent c++. We ported the app from desktop to windows mobile, iOS and Android in very quick time. The app engine was put between the human interface layer and output layer in all the platfrom. Its easy to sketch on site since its free form drawing and you can draw from any point and in any direction while on the site and combine the lines to a meaningful shape. Sketch like paper and pen was a concept that we included in the tablet sketching mode and has recieved a lot of appreciation for that. After contract with Apex Software, our software was withdrawn from the market.
